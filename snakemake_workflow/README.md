# Snakemake workflow for generating linkage maps and output for rQTL

This is a bioinformatics workflow implemented in the [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) workflow system. It uses [Lep-MAP3](https://sourceforge.net/p/lep-map3/wiki/LM3%20Home/), [Stacks](https://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/stacks/), and [R](https://www.r-project.org/).

For proper functioning, the file scripts.zip has to be downloaded from the [Lep-MAP site](https://sourceforge.net/projects/lep-map3/files/) and extracted in the scripts folder of the workflow and the folder has to be renamed to lepmap.
